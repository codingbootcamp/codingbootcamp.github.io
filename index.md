## Welcome to Coding Bootcamp
The idea is to build stuff. So we took up a few concepts of a modern application and thought to ourselves, let's gather a bunch of hackers and build one.

Albeit tiny, this is our attempt to give back to the eco system in some way. 

Please fill up the [questionaire](https://goo.gl/forms/l6XTY2CISpEx2Vz02) so that we get a better hang of things you might expect of us.




The bootcamp will be of two parts of about 3-4 hours each. In first part of the camp we will learn and build a working application with separate frontend and backend. The second part will be about Docker and how can we use it to develop the application and deploy it in production.

**For first session working knowledge of JavaScript is a must. Please read up [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**

**For second session please install Docker for you operating system from for [here](https://www.docker.com/)**


### Building JavaScript Application
In this session we will learn how a modern web application is developed and deployed. The application will have a backend which will serve data via APIs and frontend will consume the data and present it using UI components. After developing the application we will deploy the application on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which allows a developer to deploy application without any prior knowledge of DevOps.


### Introduction To Docker
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows us to eliminate "works on my machine" problem by creating isolated containers which can be created and discarded as and when needed. This session will walk you through the process of using Docker for the application which was developed in the previous session. This session will also introduce you to docker compose which is another tool to run multiple micro services.
